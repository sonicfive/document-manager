# Document Manager
A simple document manager built with Laravel PHP, and VueJS.
It uses [Uploadcare](https://www.uploadcare.com) for securely uploading and storing files.

2 Types of users are created: managers and regular users. 
A manager can create resources and assign them to regular users. 
Users can only see resources assigned to them.

Feature tests are included.
